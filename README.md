Code and functions for Bayesian linear modelling in R

The code found within `Wilkes_2021_JMSACL.R` supersedes the `clusterBootSample` and `clusterBootstrapFitParallel` functions found within the `ed-wilkes/general-modelling` repo. This code is explored in [Wilkes *et al.* (2021) *JMSACL*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34820670/).

The code found within `ClinChem_2022-hvac049_bayesian_laboratory_medicine_with_figures.rmd` is explored in [Wilkes EH (2022) *Clin Chem*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35708152/).
